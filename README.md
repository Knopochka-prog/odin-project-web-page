# odin-project-web-page
In this project I will be creating an entire web page from a design that Odin Project provide. This project will show if I posess enough skills in order to accomplish it, such as properly combining computer languages like HTML and CSS. 
The design that is provided as example comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors that I should use.
